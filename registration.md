## Registration

If you are an early career faculty member, or national lab researcher in an equivalent position at a U.S. institution working in or around the area of combustion and feel you should be invited, [please apply for consideration](https://gfhq1yex2pg.typeform.com/to/htCggi08).

Participants will receive travel funds to cover one hotel night and 1.5 days of meals.
In addition, applications from non-R1 institutions will be eligible for an additional 
$300 travel grant to help ensure a diverse set of participants. Details about 
applying for this additional funding can be found in the online application.

**Note**: Since the workshop is funded by an NSF award, it is open to people from US institutions only.
Participants do not need to be US citizens, but should be employed at a US-based university
or national laboratory.

### Travel reimbursement

Details for travel reimbursement are forthcoming. Please contact Daniel I. Pineda (<daniel.pineda@utsa.edu>) with any questions.
